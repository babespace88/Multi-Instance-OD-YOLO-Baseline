# Multi-Instance-OD-YOLO-Baseline


---> A Multi-Instance OD YOLO Baseline is a basic object detection system using the YOLO model, set up to find and label multiple objects of the same kind in an image.



Why using .yaml data format?


---> Using data.yml keeps your data organized and tells YOLO exactly what you want it to do for multi-instance detection tasks.
